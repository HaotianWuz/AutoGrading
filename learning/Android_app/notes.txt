So far there are a couple of different options to build what we have into an Android app. 
1. Use python library to directly export our current code into an apk
Examples: Qpython,SL4A,kivy
Advantages: Easy to accomplish,
Possible drawbacks: Python is not the best programming language for Android app development and there might be bugs in the exported app
The UI design might also be a problem
2. Use Java and Android Studio to re-write the whole program again
Advantages: More customization capabilities and less likely to have bugs
Drawbacks: Takes more time to learn and Java may not have as many libraries as python so there might be inconvenience implementing what 
we have now. 
Possible fix: Most of the image processing we've done are accomplished by our own functions and only a small portion of the code depends
on openCV on python. OpenCV also supports Java so if I'm able to learn the syntax of Java quickly I think I can finish the project with a
reasonable amount of time.
